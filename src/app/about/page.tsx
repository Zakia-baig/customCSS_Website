                    Hello! I’m Zakia Baig, a passionate web developer and designer with expertise in 
                    frontend technologies and SEO. I hold a master’s degree in Economics from Karachi University 
                    and have received advanced programming training at Governor House. I love creating visually 
                    appealing and functional websites, combining technical skills with a keen eye for design.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Over the years, I’ve worked on various projects, from interactive applications like a 
                    currency converter and ATM simulator to personal projects showcasing my knowledge in 
                    JavaScript, React, and Next.js. My goal is to continually learn and adapt to new technologies 
                    and trends, bringing fresh ideas to every project I undertake.
